Virtual Machine Manager (vvm) is a bunch of wrapper scripts on top of
existing Virtualization softwares. Vvm makes it easier to start and
stop such machines and execute program (typically to perform tests) on
these virtual machines.

Vvm is written in Bash and uses SSH to communicate/execute programs on
the various machines.

Vvm is part of Free Software Client Reference System (FSCRS). FSCRS is
a project at TIS Innovation Park in South Tyrol.
