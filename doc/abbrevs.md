# Abbreviations

*Machine* - A virtual image as accessible by the supported virtualization softwares (e.g Virtualbox, qemu). A machine may be used by several clients (or none). 

*Client* - A system configuration used by vvm to manage machines. Each client must belong to one (and only) one machine for the client. Separating clients from machines makes it easy for you to use one machine (the actual runnable virtual image) in many clients with different setups such as user, log files and timeouts.
