# Configuration syntax

The syntax for setting a variable is the same as in bash scrips (no coincidence!). Basically you write:

`VARIABLE=VALUE`

## Variables

`LOG_FILE_DIR=/tmp/vmm/log` - sets the log file base directory to /tmp/vmm/log. This means that all logs can be found here.

`VM_STARTUP_TIMEOUT=10` - the time to wait for a virtual machine to start up before considering it to be 'dead'.

`VM_STOP_TIMEOUT=20` - the time to wait for a virtual machine to start up before taking more drastic actions to take down the machine. Ultimately VVM will take down a machine with a `kill`.

`SSH=ssh` - the SSH program to use

`SSH_TEST_OPTIONS=" -o connectTimeout=3"` - the options to pass to the SSH program (see SSH variable above) when testing of the machine is up (or not).

`VM_NAME="Debian6.0"` - the name of the machine to use in this client. It is important that your Virtualization software can find this machine.

`VM_TYPE="VirtualBox"` - what type of Virtulization software this machine belongs to. Currently you can use: VirtualBox and qemu

`VM_IP_ADDRESS=192.168.x.x` - the IP address of the virtual machine 

`VM_USER=$USER` - the user you want to use when accessing the virtual machine

`VM_SUPERUSER=root` - the name of the super user/administrator account, typically used to reboot the machine 

`SSH_PORT=22` - the port where the SSH server is running on the client

`SSH_SHUTDOWN_COMMAND="shutdown -h now"` - VVM will do its very best to shut down a machine as gracefully as possible. One way to do this is to try to shut it down using SSH. The command in this variable will be used to do that.
