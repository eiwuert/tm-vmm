## eGov Overview

VMM is used to test eGovernment services that can only be accessed using a smart card. eGovernment services can vary from country to country but generally it grants citizens access to important documents and information. In most EU countries there are additional services like paying property tax that can be done online. Most governments in Europe are leaning in this direction in order to decrease administrative overhead. 

The drivers that are currently being used for the smart card testing are the OpenSC drivers and so far they have been working really well.

There are two types of cards that are currently being tested in Italy. 

* Running pkcs15-tool -D from a shell outputs the following:

`Using reader with a card: ACS ACR38U-CCID 00 00`  
`PKCS#15 Card [USER]:`
`	Version        : 0`
`	Serial number  : 6041110748903908`  
`	Manufacturer ID: IC: Infineon; mask: Siemens`  
`	Flags          :`   
  

* A newer card has recently been released:
  
`Using reader with a card: ACS ACR38U-CCID 00 00`  
`PKCS#15 Card [BEATRICE CORALIA DALI]:`  
`	Version        : 0`
`	Serial number  : 6041500113627001`
`	Manufacturer ID: IC: ATMEL; mask: Athena`  
`	Flags          :`   
  

With the OpenSC drivers installed (found in the repos of most major Linux distributions) and Firefox setup, everything works.

## eGov mobile testing

Another challenge to overcome will be testing eGov services on mobile platforms, more specifially automating tests under Android.
Good news is this is possible using Selenium. The one major obstacle that we face is getting around the smart card login. So
far I am unaware of getting this to work under Android unless you patch the kernel and this is of course no an option. More documentation
and research is needed concerning this.x
