# VMM - Virtual Machine Manager

VMM is software that is part of the [Testing
Machine](https://testingmachine.eu/) project.

## About the Testing Machine project

Testingmachine is primarily used to test eGovernment services.  The
eGovernment services can vary from country to country but generally it
grants citizens access to important documents and information. In most
EU countries there are additional services like paying property tax
that can be done online. Most governments in Europe are leaning in
this direction in order to decrease administrative overhead.

## Reporting bugs

Bugs can be reported to either the mailing-list or the [issues
page](https://github.com/tis-innovation-park/vmm/issues?state=open).

Try to be as precise as possible when reporting bugs. The more
information we get the bigger chance we have of fixing the problem.
